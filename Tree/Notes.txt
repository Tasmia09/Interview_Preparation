Terminology summary
	Root is the topmost node of the tree
	Edge is the link between two nodes
	Child is a node that has a parent node
	Parent is a node that has an edge to a child node
	Leaf is a node that does not have a child node in the tree
	Height is the length of the longest path to a leaf
	Depth is the length of the path to its root
	
Binary Tree:
	Each node has up to two children
	
	
Binary Search Tree:
	It is a binary tree where every node fits a specific ordering property:
		all left descendent <= n < all right descendents ==> has to be true for each node n
		
DFS:
	 “is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure. One starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.”
	 
BFS:
	“is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure. It starts at the tree root and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.”
	
	
DFS: pre-order, in-order, and post-order
